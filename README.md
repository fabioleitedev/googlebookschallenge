# HomeSpring Challenge ðŸ“š
This is a React / Node.js challenge for HomeSpring company.

## Technical Considerations
- I'm using Lerna to use a monorepo to this challenge.
- Using NestJS framework for the backend.

### Web Frontend
- Coded in React and Typescript.
- Using Jest for some tests.
- I addded some good UX behaviors that I consider important like skeletons and disabling components while querying the API.
- As a "challenge" perspective, I decided not changing the original structure of the React app.

### API Backend
- Coded in Node.js and Typescript
- Using NestJS framework.


## Requirements to Start
- Git
- Yarn
- Lerna

## How to Start?
- Run ``yarn install`` in the root folder
- Then, run ``yarn start`` to start both frontend and backend projects
- Access the frontend app at ``localhost:3000``
- Access the backend API at ``localhost:5000``
- And have fun! ðŸ¤“
